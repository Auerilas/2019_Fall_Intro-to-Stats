We will cover a lot of basic material here. Don't worry if it seems like a lot, we will be using these methods every week. The idea is to get you comfortable with Python and Jupyter notebookes, and to provide you a reference to work from in the following weeks. Be sure to execture any code you see by clicking on the box, then hitting Run/ctrl+Enter/cmd+Enter.\n",
