	a. Have the students work through both symbolic and numerical linear algebra exercises by hand.
		i. This could also be a lead-in to multiple regression

2. Linear regression again
	a. Go through the whole process again, but in linear algebra form (repetition)

3. Transformations
	a. Go through the whole process again, this time with standardized variables

	b. What did this do to uncertainty? Parameter estimates? R2? Covariance plots?
