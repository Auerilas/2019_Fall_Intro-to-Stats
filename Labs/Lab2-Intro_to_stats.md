1. Introduction to PYSTAN
	a. the blocks
	
	b. a basic model estimating the mean
		i. A one-sample t-test
			A. One-tailed
			B. Two-tailed
		
		ii. can use this as a basic introduction to statistical inference
			A. point estimates
		
			B. uncertainty
				1. Tie this into lecture
			
			C. confidence intervals
			
			D. adjust sample size and effect size to prove a point about significance
				1. uncertainty goes down as N goes up.
				
				2. is it more important to be significant, or to know the effect size and uncertainty?
					a. keep this in mind when both writing and reviewing papers
				
				3. a good for-loop experiment
					a. Potentially a nested for-loop, varying both sigma and n
	
	c. comparing two groups
		i. Homogenous variances
			A. standard way
		
			B. difference way
		
		ii. Heterogeneous variances
			A. standard way
		
			B. difference way
