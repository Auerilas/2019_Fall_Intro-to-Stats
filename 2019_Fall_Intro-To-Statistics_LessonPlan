## Week 1

### Lecture Day

1. Introduction
	a) Who I am
	b) What the course is
		i. The idea is to learn statistics (obviously)
		ii. No "cookbook" approach of stepping through textbooks.
		iii. No theorems or analytical proofs
		iv. Instead, will learn linear models. Everything done via simulation
		v. Computational, rather than analytical, approach. Using Python and PySTAN
		vi. We can't cover it all. Just the basics. Going to "go slow". Hopefully give you the tools you need to understand textbooks and more advanced materials when you need them.
			A. Using 'Bayesian' software but not discussing 'Bayesian' analyses because no priors
			B. So everything we're doing is really 'frequentist' statistics (don't confuse that)
	c) Materials
		i. No required books
		ii. Recommended books
			A. Draper and Smith - Applied Regression
			B. Ramsey and Schafer - Statistical Sleuth
			C. Gelman and Hill - Applied regression and multilevel models
		iii. Laptop
	d) Survey
		i. Prior stats experience?
		ii. Prior programming experience?
		iii. Will pretend no one has any
	e) Format
		i. It's a 2 credit class, but we'll meet for more than two hours
		ii. One lecture day (1 hour)
			A. No powerpoints, stats can't be taught using powerpoint
		iii. One computer "lab" day (2 hours)
			A. Hands on practice with programming and stats
			B. Will also cover some new material because 1 lecture hours isn't enough
	f) Grading
		i. No tests or midterms (test memorization, not learning)
		ii. The key to learning is practice, practice, practice
		iii. Weekly lab exercises (given on lab day, to be turned in by the next lecture)
			A. This will be detailed (like I said, might include new material: both stats and programming)
			B. These can be started in class, I will be there to help.
			C. Can come to me for office hours
			D. Distributed via github. Turn the notebook in to me digitally.
		iv. Weekly quizzes (given on lecture day, to be turned in by next lab)
			A. Will be short, often one or two detailed analysis questions. Only on previous material
			B. Distributed via github. Turn the quiz in digitially.
		v. By design (and by nature), stats education is cumulative. You need to show up every week and do the work every week to understand what goes on the next week.
	g) Final project
		i. Analyze real datasets to ask real questions
			A. Can use your own data (talk to me first)
			B. I'm happy to provide data for those that don't have it

2. Getting the Anaconda Python environment set up
	a) Download Anaconda and install
		i. Make sure hit 'yes' on the path
		ii. Run 'python' from the terminal, check for Anaconda
		iii. conda-forge
		iv. update all packages
		v. install PyStan
	b) IDE
		i. Show mine (sublime + terminal)
		ii. Spyder
		iii. Atom
		iv. PyCharm
		v. Visual Studio
		vi. Google Python IDE and pick yours!
		vii. Jupyter notebook

### Lab Day

1. Introduction to Python (NEED TO READ SOME INTRO TO PYTHON BOOKS HERE)
	a) Python is a calculator
	b) Objects
	c) Attributes and methods
	d) for loops
		i. regular
		ii. nested
	e) Modules
	f) Graphics
		i. Graphics are a good way to start here







## Week 2

### Lecture Day

1. What is statistics?
	a) "statistics provides standards of empirical proof" - Ramsey and Schaffer
	b) "how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data" - Diez et al
	c) statistics provide a way to discriminate between variation that is "background" and variation that is "scientifically interesting" - Crawley
	d) "how much variation do we expect by chance" - Crawley
		i. 'significance'
		ii. why 'significance' is stupid
		iii. focus on estimation / effect size / uncertainty

### Lab Day
1. Introduction to PYSTAN
	a) the blocks
	b) a basic model estimating the mean
		i. can use this as a one-sample t-test
		ii. can use this as a basic introduction to statistical inference
			A. point estimates
			B. uncertainty
			C. confidence intervals
			D. adjust sample size and effect size to prove a point about significance
				1. uncertainty goes down as N goes up.
				2. is it more important to be significant, or to know the effect size and uncertainty?
					a) keep this in mind when both writing and reviewing papers
				3. a good for-loop experiment
